### Analysis - Emily Boulware

- When comparing the four treatment regimens with the lowest SEM (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin), it appears that Capomulin and Ramicane reduce tumor volume far better than Infubinol or Ceftamin. 

- Interestingly, when isolating Mouse ID "i509" under the Capomulin treatment regimen we see tumor volume drastically reduce between days 20-35; however, tumor volume began increasing from days 35-45. Further investigation would be required to determine Capomulin's longterm efficacy. 

- While mouse weight (g) was considered for the Capomulin treatment regimen summaries, mouse age (months) and mouse sex were not. Additional summaries would be needed to see if there is any relation between mouse age, sex and Capomulin's efficacy on tumor volume.
